A Ruby UI component library for DaisyUI using Phlex ‚ú®

# ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

## 1. Install CSS dependencies

You can install TailwindCSS and DaisyUI either via a JS bundler or via importmaps.

### JS Bundler

**TailwindCSS**

Install TailwindCSS by following the instructions in the TailwindCSS documentation, using either the Tailwind CLI or PostCSS.

**DaisyUI**

Install DaisyUI by following the instructions in the DaisyUI documentation as a Node package.

### Importmaps

**TailwindCSS with DaisyUI**

You'll need to download a TailwindCSS standalone CLI that comes bundled with DaisyUI by following the instructions in the [tailwind-cli-extra repo](https://github.com/dobicinaitis/tailwind-cli-extra).

Afterwards, place it somewhere in your project, e.g. in the bin directory.

If you want to compile the standalone TailwindCSS CLI with DaisyUI yourself, you can follow the instructions here.

**tailwindcss-rails gem**

Install tailwindcss-rails gem for Rails to automatically include your TailwindCSS stylesheets when the asset pipeline compiles your assets.

For this, you'll need to install the gem by following the instructions in the [tailwindcss-rails repo](https://github.com/rails/tailwindcss-rails).

Finally, you'll need to set the `TAILWINDCSS_INSTALL_DIR` environment variable in your Rails app pointing to the directory where you plaed the binary from the tailwind-cli-extra repo mentioned above. e.g. `TAILWINDCSS_INSTALL_DIR=bin`

### 2. Install Ruby dependencies

#### Install Phlex

Install Phlex by following the instructions in the [Phlex documentation](https://www.phlex.fun/#rails-introduction).

#### Install PhlexyUI

1. Add the PhlexyUI gem to your Gemfile:

```
bundle add phlexy_ui
```

2. Include the `PhlexyUI` module in `ApplicationComponent`:

```rb
class ApplicationComponent < Phlex::HTML
  include PhlexyUI
end
```

3. Update your `tailwind.config.js` file to include PhlexyUI styles:

```js
const execSync = require("child_process").execSync;
const outputPhlexyUI = execSync("bundle show phlexy_ui", { encoding: "utf-8" });
const phlexyUIPath = outputPhlexyUI.trim() + "/**/*.rb";
module.exports = {
  content: [
    // ... other paths
    phlexyUIPath,
  ],
};
```

4. Update your tailwind.config.js file to detect TailwindCSS classes in Ruby files.

```js
module.exports = {
  content: [
    // ... other paths
    //
    // Note the "rb" extension at the end
    "./app/views/**/*.{erb,haml,html,slim,rb}",
  ],
};
```

# üí° Usage

Refer to [the docs](https://phlexyui.com) to see how to use components. Here's an example:

```rb
Card :base_100 do |card|
  figure do
    img(src:)
  end
  card.body do
    card.title do
      "Shoes!"
    end
    p do
      "If a dog chews shoes whose shoes does he choose?"
    end
    card.actions class: "justify-end" do
      Button :primary do
        "Buy Now"
      end
    end
  end
end
```

Which produces:
